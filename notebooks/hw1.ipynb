    "**<span style=\"color: red\">NOTE</span>:** When setting up and running my data gathering script, I misread the assignment instructions and downloaded option/price data for the SPX index rather than the SPY ETF. I did not realize this until after Thursday's trading hours and therefore could not switch out the data for the correct ticker. I anticipate the results will be very similar. Vol/open interest relative to the contract size being 10x as much seems in line with SPY on yahoo finance when I checked, potentially smaller. I would anticipate liquidity is at worst similar since the granularity of contracts is higher on SPX (every 5 index points at the money, where SPY trades around 1/10th the value and has every $1-spaced options at the money), and SPY mostly does a good job tracking SPX so I don't think this will have a major impact on analysis or results.\n",

    "- Why do additional maturities exist? Given that TSLA, SPX, and VIX are all highly liquid, popular tickers with a lot of speculative interest, traders have demand for products that speculate on volatility/short term movements with finer control over the time window than the traditional monthly schedule, especially as the maturity date approaches. Therefore exchanges/market makers introduce options with more maturities as these dates approach, meeting demand without fragmenting long-term maturity liquidity (eg a month or two out, weekly options may be introduced, and a week or so out, daily options may be introduced in the case of SPX)."
